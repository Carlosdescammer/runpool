# RunPool ‚Äì Social Running Challenges with Real Money Stakes

**RunPool** is a comprehensive platform that transforms running into a social, competitive, and financially motivated experience. Create weekly running challenges with friends, colleagues, or communities where participants put money on the line to achieve distance goals. Winners split the prize pool from those who don't complete their goals.

## What RunPool Does

RunPool gamifies running by combining social accountability, friendly competition, and real financial stakes. It's designed for groups who want to stay motivated, push each other, and make running more engaging through structured weekly challenges.

### The Core Concept
- **Create a Group**: Set up a running group with custom rules, entry fees, and weekly distance goals
- **Weekly Challenges**: Each week, participants pay an entry fee to join that week's challenge
- **Submit Proof**: Upload screenshots from fitness apps (Strava, Apple Fitness, Garmin, etc.) showing completed runs
- **Automatic Payouts**: Winners who meet the goal split the prize money from those who don't
- **Real-Time Competition**: Live leaderboards track progress throughout the week

### How It Works
1. **Group Setup**: A "Coach" creates a group and sets the weekly rule (e.g., "Run 5+ miles")
2. **Weekly Entry**: Participants opt-in each week by paying the entry fee via Stripe
3. **Run & Prove**: Complete your runs and upload proof screenshots showing distance, date, and time
4. **Verification**: Coaches verify submitted proofs for authenticity
5. **Payout**: At week's end, winners split the prize pool from participants who didn't complete the goal
6. **Repeat**: New challenge starts the following week with the same or updated rules

## Core Features

- **Automated Escrow System**: Secure handling of entry fees and prize distribution
- **Stripe Connect Integration**: Secure payment processing and payouts
- **Proof Verification**: Submit and verify run proofs with timestamps and distance
- **Automated Payouts**: Winners are paid automatically when the challenge ends
- **Transparent Fee Structure**: Clear breakdown of all fees before payment
- **Real-time Leaderboard**: Track progress and standings throughout the week

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with your Supabase project values:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...     # server-only, used by admin functions

# Email System (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=...                # Your Resend API key
RESEND_FROM="Runpool <no-reply@runpool.space>"  # Must match verified domain

# Email Testing & Security
WEEKLY_RECAP_TEST_TO=you@example.com,teammate@example.com  # Test recipients
CRON_SECRET=some-strong-secret    # Optional: protects cron endpoints

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yoursite.com  # Used for email links
```

**Important**: Ensure `RESEND_FROM` uses proper email format with verified domain. Duplicate entries will cause the second to override the first.

## Supabase Setup

- Ensure tables like `groups`, `memberships`, `challenges`, `proofs`, `invites`, and `email_preferences` exist.
- Enable RLS and add policies so only group owners/admins can edit/delete groups and manage invites.
- Admin page includes a client guard, but security must be enforced by RLS.

### Email Preferences Database Schema

Apply the SQL from `supabase/sql/email_preferences.sql` to add:

- `email_preferences` table with user notification controls
- RLS policies for secure preference management  
- Helper functions: `get_user_email_preferences()` and `update_user_email_preferences()`

This enables granular opt-in/opt-out controls for all email notification types.

### Security: Recommended RPC & RLS (Email-locked joins)

To enforce email-locked joins at the database level (source of truth), apply the SQL in:

- `supabase/sql/join_enforcement.sql`

What it does:

- Defines `join_group_with_token_email(p_token text)` which:
  - Verifies token exists and is not expired.
  - Enforces that the JWT email matches `invited_email` when present.
  - Inserts a `memberships` row (if not already a member) and consumes the invite.
- RLS policies:
  - Blocks direct `INSERT` into `memberships` by authenticated users (forces use of the RPC).
  - Restricts invite management to group admins/owners.

How to apply:

1) Open Supabase SQL editor and paste the contents of `supabase/sql/join_enforcement.sql`, or include it in your migrations.
2) Ensure your JWT includes the `email` claim (Supabase default for email/password auth).
3) On the client, continue to call `join_group_with_token_email`; legacy RPC is still used as a fallback.

### Optional RPC for Atomic Deletion

App prefers an RPC named `delete_group_cascade` to delete a group and related rows atomically, with a client-side fallback if RPC is absent. Example PostgreSQL function signature:

```sql
create or replace function delete_group_cascade(p_group_id uuid)
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from proofs where challenge_id in (select id from challenges where group_id = p_group_id);
  delete from challenges where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from invites where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from memberships where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from groups where id = p_group_id;
end; $$;
```

Grant execute to relevant roles if needed.

## Directory Highlights

- `app/group/[id]/page.tsx` ‚Äì group dashboard; shows Admin button for owners/admins.
- `app/group/[id]/admin/page.tsx` ‚Äì admin tools (edit settings, weeks, invites, delete).
- `app/signin/page.tsx` ‚Äì email/password auth + post-auth redirect.
- `lib/supabaseClient.ts` ‚Äì Supabase client.

### Email Notification System

The comprehensive email system includes multiple notification types:

**API Endpoints:**
- `app/api/notify/weekly-goals/route.ts` - End-of-week goal reminder emails
- `app/api/notify/top-performer/route.ts` - Personal celebration emails for top 3 achievements  
- `app/api/notify/admin-new-user/route.ts` - Admin alerts for new group members
- `app/api/notify/proof/route.ts` - Activity notifications and top-3 milestone updates
- `app/api/weekly-recap/route.ts` - Weekly summary emails with leaderboards
- `app/api/test-emails/route.ts` - Template preview and testing interface

**Testing Email Templates:**

Visit `/api/test-emails` to preview all email templates or test individual endpoints:

```bash
# Test weekly goal reminders
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/notify/weekly-goals' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"group_id":"uuid","test_mode":true}'

# Test weekly recap
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/weekly-recap?limit=5&send=1' \
  -H 'x-cron-secret: your-secret'

# Test top performer notifications  
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/notify/top-performer' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id":"uuid","group_id":"uuid","rank":1,"test_mode":true}'
```

**Automated Scheduling (Vercel Cron):**

Configured in `vercel.json`:
- Saturday 8PM: Weekly goal reminder checks (`/api/notify/weekly-goals`)
- Monday 9AM: Weekly recap delivery (`/api/weekly-recap?send=1`)

All endpoints respect user email preferences and include proper error handling.

- **Template previews**: Visit `/api/test-emails` to view all email templates
- **Weekly reminders**: Test `/api/notify/weekly-goals` with test mode
