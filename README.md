  - **Impact**: All email sending was failing silently
  - **Fix**: Removed duplicate entry, kept proper format `"Runpool <no-reply@runpool.space>"`
  - **File**: `.env.local`

- **Character Encoding Issues in Emails** (Critical Fix)
  - **Problem**: Emails displayed "funny characters that don't make sense" due to missing charset declarations
  - **Impact**: Poor user experience with garbled text in email clients
  - **Fix**: Added proper HTML DOCTYPE, UTF-8 charset declarations, and HTML entity encoding
  - **Files**: All email template functions across `/api/notify/*` and `/api/weekly-recap`

- **Top-Performer Template Inconsistency** (UI Fix)
  - **Problem**: Test email template for top-performer alerts wasn't updated with premium design
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent email appearance between test previews and actual notifications
  - **Fix**: Updated `/api/test-emails/route.ts` with matching premium template design
  - **Files**: `/api/test-emails/route.ts`

### Previous Updates (2025-08-23)

- **Light-only Sage Theme**: Removed all Tailwind `dark:` classes and disabled dark mode across the app.
  - Forced light theme via `ThemeProvider` (`defaultTheme="light"`, `enableSystem={false}`) in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Set a single light `viewport.themeColor` of `#DAD7CD` in both `src/app/layout.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx`.
  - Removed `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` overrides from `src/app/globals.css` and `app/globals.css`.
  - Updated shared components to ensure light surfaces/colors only: `components/ui/{card,input,badge,button,avatar,progress,label,skeleton}.tsx`.
  - Cleaned dark classes from pages: `app/group/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/group/[id]/admin/page.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.

- **Prioritized email invite flow** (`app/group/[id]/admin/page.tsx`): textarea for multiple emails; sends Supabase magic-link emails; shows active and expired invites; supports resending per-invite when `invited_email` is known; supports revoking.
- **Legacy invites de-emphasized**: legacy "Generate invite link" moved into a `<details>` section labeled "Legacy" to steer users toward email invites.
- **Back to dashboard**:
  - On-page back button in the admin card header linking to `/group/[id]`.
  - Global header shows a route-aware "Back" button on `/group/[id]/admin` (with or without trailing slash).
- **Leaderboard gamification** (`app/group/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Podium colors for ranks 1‚Äì3.
  - Streak badges derived from recent challenge participation.
  - Rank deltas computed using a localStorage snapshot of previous ranks.
  - Enter/leave top-3 join/drop animations.

- **Realtime leaderboard** (`app/group/[id]/page.tsx`): Subscribes to `proofs` changes for the active challenge via Supabase Realtime and refreshes `leaderboard_week` instantly.
- **Email-locked joins** (`app/join/page.tsx`): If an invite has `invited_email`, the join flow requires the signed-in email to match (case-insensitive). Uses `join_group_with_token_email` with legacy RPC fallback.

- **Secure invite fetch**: Added `get_invite_public(p_token text)` security-definer RPC to fetch limited invite fields by token and updated the Join page to use it instead of reading the `invites` table directly.
- **Weekly recap API**: Implemented `app/api/weekly-recap/route.ts` to compute recaps for recent CLOSED challenges and optionally send emails via Resend (`send=1`). Endpoint can be protected via `x-cron-secret` if `CRON_SECRET` is set.

## Bugs fixed

- **Missing `invited_email` column in SQL**: Applying DB enforcement failed with `column i.invited_email does not exist`.
  - Fix: added `alter table if exists public.invites add column if not exists invited_email text;` at the top of `supabase/sql/join_enforcement.sql`.
- **Invite visibility vs. RLS**: Join page previously read `invites` directly, which can be blocked by strict RLS.
  - Fix: created security-definer RPC `get_invite_public(p_token text)` (limited fields) and updated `app/join/page.tsx` to call it.
- **Deno TS import lint in Edge Function**: Local TypeScript tooling flagged Deno URL imports.
  - Fix: added `// @ts-nocheck` to `supabase/functions/weekly-recap/index.ts` to avoid Node-oriented linting.
 - **Back navigation missing on Admin**: Back button wasn‚Äôt visible in some admin routes (e.g., trailing slash).
  - Fix: added on-page back control and header-level route detection that handles `/group/[id]/admin` and `/group/[id]/admin/`.

## What's next

- **Weekly recap email**: scheduled weekly summary with winners, streaks, and deltas (Supabase Scheduled Functions / Edge Functions).
- **Invite UX**: tooltips/docs explaining email vs legacy invites; optional full removal of legacy links.
- **Admin enhancements**: bulk revoke, manual expire, CSV import for emails.
- **More gamification**: milestone badges, streak decay warnings, confetti for podium changes, animated progress.
- **Security/RLS**: tighten policies around invites and membership creation.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

Scripts:

```bash
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run build     # production build (Turbopack)
npm run start     # start production server
npm run lint      # run ESLint
```

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with your Supabase project values:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...     # server-only, used by admin functions

# Email System (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=...                # Your Resend API key
RESEND_FROM="Runpool <no-reply@runpool.space>"  # Must match verified domain

# Email Testing & Security
WEEKLY_RECAP_TEST_TO=you@example.com,teammate@example.com  # Test recipients
CRON_SECRET=some-strong-secret    # Optional: protects cron endpoints

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yoursite.com  # Used for email links
```

**Important**: Ensure `RESEND_FROM` uses proper email format with verified domain. Duplicate entries will cause the second to override the first.

## Supabase Setup

- Ensure tables like `groups`, `memberships`, `challenges`, `proofs`, `invites`, and `email_preferences` exist.
- Enable RLS and add policies so only group owners/admins can edit/delete groups and manage invites.
- Admin page includes a client guard, but security must be enforced by RLS.

### Email Preferences Database Schema

Apply the SQL from `supabase/sql/email_preferences.sql` to add:

- `email_preferences` table with user notification controls
- RLS policies for secure preference management  
- Helper functions: `get_user_email_preferences()` and `update_user_email_preferences()`

This enables granular opt-in/opt-out controls for all email notification types.

### Security: Recommended RPC & RLS (Email-locked joins)

To enforce email-locked joins at the database level (source of truth), apply the SQL in:

- `supabase/sql/join_enforcement.sql`

What it does:

- Defines `join_group_with_token_email(p_token text)` which:
  - Verifies token exists and is not expired.
  - Enforces that the JWT email matches `invited_email` when present.
  - Inserts a `memberships` row (if not already a member) and consumes the invite.
- RLS policies:
  - Blocks direct `INSERT` into `memberships` by authenticated users (forces use of the RPC).
  - Restricts invite management to group admins/owners.

How to apply:

1) Open Supabase SQL editor and paste the contents of `supabase/sql/join_enforcement.sql`, or include it in your migrations.
2) Ensure your JWT includes the `email` claim (Supabase default for email/password auth).
3) On the client, continue to call `join_group_with_token_email`; legacy RPC is still used as a fallback.

### Optional RPC for Atomic Deletion

App prefers an RPC named `delete_group_cascade` to delete a group and related rows atomically, with a client-side fallback if RPC is absent. Example PostgreSQL function signature:

```sql
create or replace function delete_group_cascade(p_group_id uuid)
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from proofs where challenge_id in (select id from challenges where group_id = p_group_id);
  delete from challenges where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from invites where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from memberships where group_id = p_group_id;
  delete from groups where id = p_group_id;
end; $$;
```

Grant execute to relevant roles if needed.

## Directory Highlights

- `app/group/[id]/page.tsx` ‚Äì group dashboard; shows Admin button for owners/admins.
- `app/group/[id]/admin/page.tsx` ‚Äì admin tools (edit settings, weeks, invites, delete).
- `app/signin/page.tsx` ‚Äì email/password auth + post-auth redirect.
- `lib/supabaseClient.ts` ‚Äì Supabase client.

### Email Notification System

The comprehensive email system includes multiple notification types:

**API Endpoints:**
- `app/api/notify/weekly-goals/route.ts` - End-of-week goal reminder emails
- `app/api/notify/top-performer/route.ts` - Personal celebration emails for top 3 achievements  
- `app/api/notify/admin-new-user/route.ts` - Admin alerts for new group members
- `app/api/notify/proof/route.ts` - Activity notifications and top-3 milestone updates
- `app/api/weekly-recap/route.ts` - Weekly summary emails with leaderboards
- `app/api/test-emails/route.ts` - Template preview and testing interface

**Testing Email Templates:**

Visit `/api/test-emails` to preview all email templates or test individual endpoints:

```bash
# Test weekly goal reminders
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/notify/weekly-goals' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"group_id":"uuid","test_mode":true}'

# Test weekly recap
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/weekly-recap?limit=5&send=1' \
  -H 'x-cron-secret: your-secret'

# Test top performer notifications  
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/notify/top-performer' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id":"uuid","group_id":"uuid","rank":1,"test_mode":true}'
```

**Automated Scheduling (Vercel Cron):**

Configured in `vercel.json`:
- Saturday 8PM: Weekly goal reminder checks (`/api/notify/weekly-goals`)
- Monday 9AM: Weekly recap delivery (`/api/weekly-recap?send=1`)

All endpoints respect user email preferences and include proper error handling.
